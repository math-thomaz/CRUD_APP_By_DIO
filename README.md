# The Series Database 
# About the project

This is a simple CRUD application exercise written with C# and compiled as a Console Application. It contains simple tasks, like add, list, alter and mark a item as removed.

As it does not have any communication with some database, an array was used for store the series data.

The application is very intuitive. Just run it and follow the instructions along as you choose some of the options.
